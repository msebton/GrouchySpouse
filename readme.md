# GrouchySpouse

A fun project that leverages multi-platform audio to produce a grouchy version of your spouse or partner. Change the system prompt by modifying system_prompt.txt. Easy! 

## Features

- Chat with an AI-powered assistant
- Maintains conversation history for context-aware responses
- Synthesizes and plays audio responses

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK
- An API key for OpenAI
- An API key for Replicate

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/FusionGuy/GrouchySpouse.git
    ```

2. Create a [system_prompt.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) file in the project directory with the desired system prompt content.

3. Update the API keys in the [InitializeClients](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) method in [Program.cs](http://_vscodecontentref_/2):
    ```csharp
    _openAIClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = 
        new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", "your-openai-api-key");
    _replicateClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = 
        new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", "your-replicate-api-key");
    ```

4. Build and run the project:
    ```sh
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

2. The application will read the system prompt from [system_prompt.txt]) and display it.

3. Start chatting with the AI assistant by typing your messages in the console.

4. The AI assistant will respond with text and synthesized audio.

5. The program will delete the audio file once played for cleanup You can comment out the code to prevent that if you wish.
